# Contributing
Inspired by [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We would love for you to contribute and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Style Guide](#style)
 - [Git Guide](#git)


## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep projects open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via [our gitter channel][gitter].


## <a name="style"></a> Style Guide
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these [coding rules](guide/STYLE_GUIDE.md) in mind as you are working.


## <a name="git"></a> Git Guide
To ensure consistency in version, keep these [git rules](guide/GIT_GUIDE.md) in mind.
