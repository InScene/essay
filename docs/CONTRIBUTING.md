# Contributing
Inspired by [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We would love for you to contribute and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Style Guide](#style)
 - [Git Guide](#git)
 - [Signing the CLA](#cla)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep projects open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via [our gitter channel][gitter].

## <a name="style"></a> Style Guide
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these [coding rules](guide/STYLE_GUIDE.md) in mind as you are working.

## <a name="git"></a> Git Guide
To ensure consistency in version, keep these [git rules](guide/GIT_GUIDE.md) in mind.

## <a name="cla"></a> Signing the CLA

Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code
changes to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!

* For individuals we have a [simple click-through form][individual-cla].
* For corporations we'll need you to
  [print, sign and one of scan+email, fax or mail the form][corporate-cla].

  If you have more than one Git identity, you must make sure that you sign the CLA using the primary email address associated with the ID that has been granted access to the Angular repository. Git identities can be associated with more than one email address, and only one is primary. Here are some links to help you sort out multiple Git identities and email addresses:

  * https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37245303/what-does-usera-committed-with-userb-13-days-ago-on-github-mean
  * https://help.github.com/articles/about-commit-email-addresses/
  * https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address/

  Note that if you have more than one Git identity, it is important to verify that you are logged in with the same ID with which you signed the CLA, before you commit changes. If not, your PR will fail the CLA check.
