 - [TSN Standards](#standards)

## <a name="standards"></a> TSN Standards
Inspired by [ee publishers](https://www.ee.co.za/article/how-time-sensitive-networking-is-revolutionising-industrial-automation.html#.X7_SRlO1Jkw).

To enable truly converged networks that can stream real-time controls, as well as audio/video in industrial facilities, the TSN task group of the IEEE 802.1 working group is defining a set of standards for the deterministic data transmission over Ethernet networks. As a collection of standards, TSN is more like a tool box than an all-in-one solution; you need to understand what “tools” are available and how each tool works in order to determine which tools are suitable for your application.
